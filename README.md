# UFO-Sightings

## Introduction

Do you believe in Alien lifes? Whether you believe or not, we have documented all of the eye-witness of UFOs over the years. In this dataset, we took the 2010 UFO witnesses and created a nice website for you to view the *date*, *city*, *state*, *country*, *shape* and *comment* of the records. Come visit the webiste and see if you find something interesting!

## Instruction

The repo consists two parts: the **static** folder and the **index.html**:
- [static](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/UFO-Sightings/tree/main/static)
    - This is the main folder that consists the **css** and **images** folders to format the website. 
    - The main folder in here is the [js folder](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/UFO-Sightings/tree/main/static/js):
        - The **app.js** file is the main script to incorporate to the HTML template
        - The **data.js** file is the source data
- [index.html](https://github.com/Grace-Bijun-Li/UFO-Sightings/blob/main/index.html)
    - This is the HTML template that allows the script to be run properly and designs the layout of the website.
